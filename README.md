**College assignment** - _Weirdly enough we use Unity to apply our physics knowledge to basic problems (cannot complain, though)_

It should be clarified that the project submitted presents a somewhat different arrangement than required. Instead of having a single particle that implements the behavior of mobile charges between two cubes that would keep it in electrostatic equilibrium, I introduced a few more at the same point. Thus, as there are no collisions, when starting the program their composite effects, with the same sign of charge of the particles, in addition to the field generated by the static section (the equidistant cubes) will generate a great impulse of the central particles, followed by some stabilization around said axis; still being subject to their own interactions, revealing a certain orbit.
